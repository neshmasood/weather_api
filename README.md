## The Work!

To keep this all fairly flexible and simple, there will be only a few requirements for this lab.

- Some sort of title
- A short description telling the user what to do
- A Button ("start" or "go" or "search")
- Thoughtful and delightful CSS and design
- An option for the user to interact with a random aspect of your API (*ex. random joke/fact/picture/etc.*)
- An option for the user to search or select information from your API (*ex. detail page for a movie, or Pokemon, or stock information*)

Essentially, we want you to make an AJAX call to an API for data, parse through the data appropriately to find specific pieces of data that a user of your application would want, and then render those pieces of data out in a thoughtful and delightful way. Now, your user has access to the API data that you have parsed. Good job! Way to parse that data and serve it up to your user! üëè
